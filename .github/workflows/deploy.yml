# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
#
# This workflow builds and deploys a Next.js static export to GitHub Pages.
# It uses the official GitHub Pages artifact + deploy actions to ensure
# the deployment is recognized by GitHub Pages UI immediately.
#
# Lockfile handling:
# - When package-lock.json exists, npm ci is used for deterministic installs
# - When package-lock.json is missing, npm install is used as a fallback
# - For best practices, generate package-lock.json locally with:
#   npm install --package-lock-only
#   Then commit the lockfile to ensure deterministic CI builds
